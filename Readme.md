🌟 Project Title: RESILIO

An AI‑Powered Platform for Student Motivation, Resilience & Psychological Well‑Being


🧩 Problem Statement

In modern education, learning platforms primarily focus on content delivery, assignments, and grades, while student motivation, resilience, and psychological well‑being remain largely unaddressed.

Students often face:

Academic stress and burnout

Low motivation and poor time management

Emotional challenges that go unnoticed

Lack of personalized academic and emotional support


Teachers, on the other hand:

Have limited visibility into students’ engagement and well‑being

Receive feedback only after academic performance declines

Lack tools for early intervention


Existing systems are reactive, not proactive, and fail to integrate mental well‑being support within the learning process.

There is a need for a scalable, ethical, AI‑driven solution that supports both learning outcomes and psychological well‑being, without replacing human educators.

💡 Proposed Solution – RESILIO

Resilio is an AI‑first, role‑based educational platform that combines:

Learning management

Motivation tracking

Resilience building

Psychological well‑being support


It uses AI agents to provide personalized, real‑time guidance to students while offering teachers early insights to support learners before academic failure occurs.
